What I Learned today:
I learned how to use the basic Git commands like git init, git commit, and git push. I now understand how to track changes in a local repository and push them to GitHub.

What I'm still confused about:
I'm still a bit unsure when to use the staging area vs committing directly. Also, how do I remove a file that was accidentally added?
