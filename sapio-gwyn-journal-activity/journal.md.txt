WHAT I LEARNED TODAY

Today, I learned more about Git commands and have a better understanding of how they work, how to use them, and how to use them more effectively. I now have a stronger grasp of the basic commands and even discovered some new ones I hadn't used before.

WHAT I'M STILL CONFUSED ABOUT	

I previously made a mistake where one of my files disappeared from both my laptop and Git, with no history or backups, so I was never able to recover it. Is there a way to reverse something like that? I tried researching it, but I still donâ€™t quite understand. It was like the file just vanished all of a sudden.
