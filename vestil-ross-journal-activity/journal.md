**What I learned in Git:**  
Today, I learned the fundamental Git commands such as git init, git add, git commit, and git push. I now understand how to initialize a repository, stage changes, commit them with a message, and finally push those commits to a remote repository like GitHub. I also learned how Git tracks the history of changes, which helps in managing different versions of a project..

**Confusion:**  
I'm still a bit confused about the purpose of the staging area—why we need to git add before committing. It’s also unclear how to properly remove a file that was mistakenly added to the staging area or committed. Do I use git rm, git reset, or something else?
