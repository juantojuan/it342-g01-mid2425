#What I learned today:
- I learned how to fork a repository, clone, add, and commit.

#What I'm still confused about: 
- I'm still trying to understand how to do these things. I'm still confused. When I forked a repository I got confused on the next steps. But I'm learning as I do things.

#PersonalComment
- I've done the forking and cloning and I'm confused on where to proceed next.
